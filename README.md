# 3d maps using Material UI - Next.js 

This prohect contains pages designed using matrial cards and map component in the same page. 

WIP: want to pass state between card and map components

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped using [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) with Material UI installed.

## How to use


Install dependencies and run:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `src/app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This example uses [`next/font/google`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts#google-fonts) to automatically optimize and load Roboto, a custom Google Font.
